            The goal of this game is simple, you will have to <b>classify the ads that sell animals</b> into two categories, legal ads and illegal ads.
            <br>
            To do this, you'll have to <b>analyze the image and description of the ad</b> to see if it respects the legislation. The ads in this game will have the following form:
        </small>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="adexample">
            <div class='markerContent' style="box-shadow: 0px 0px 6px 0px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);">
                <h2>Title of ad</h2>

            <b>To be legal</b>, an ad selling an animal online must respect all the following characteristics: 
            <br>
            <ul class="ruleslist">
                <li class="adtext">
                    The description must contain the following legal mention: 
                    <i>"An animal is a sentient living being and not a toy.
                    The purchase or adoption of an animal is done in full awareness of the responsibilities of its new owner.
                    Abandonment or negligence of an animal is an offence subject to criminal or administrative prosecution."</i>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li class="adtext">
                    All ads must include a unique approval number for the seller, which always begins with the two letters HK followed by 8 digits (ex.: HK12224566).
                </li>
                <br>
                <li class="adtext">
                    The image of the ad can only contain one single animal.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li class="adtext">
                    The ad must be published from the Brussels region or Flanders, so it cannot be published from Wallonia.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li class="adtext">
                    It is strictly forbidden to sell animals on Facebook Marketplace.
                </li>
            </ul>
            You will <b>earn points</b> based on the <b>number of correctly classified ads</b> and the <b>time you took</b> to complete the task.
            You will be able to compare your score to other players as well as to the algorithm that takes care of this task in practice.
